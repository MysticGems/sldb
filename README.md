This is intended as a replacement for the SL Experience key-value store, using AWS resources and accessible via https. It's not as secure, and slower, but it does work on land where an Experience hasnâ€™t been enabled. It should be possible to run all but very popular services on the [AWS free tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/), but it is always a good idea to set up a [billing alarm](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/monitor_estimated_charges_with_cloudwatch.html) to avoid unpleasant surprises.

# Components

## `sl/library.lsl`

Example LSL script fragments demonstrating use. Returned values from the http call are formatted like the returned values from an Experience to facilitate use as a drop-in replacement.

## `aws/lambda_function.py`

This is the Python Lambda function that handles the https request, queries the database, and returns the results.

## `aws/template.yml`

AWS CloudFormation template to build the necessary resources, including the database.

# Use

Run the CloudFormation template in your AWS account. It will build a Lambda, DynamoDB table, and necessary IAM and logging resources. You will need to provide a 20-128 character secret value. Make note of this and of the URL that is assigned to your Lambda function.

Incorporate the contents of `library.lsl` into your LSL script(s). You will need to provide the URL and secret value in the script (as `SECURE_HEADER_VALUE` and `SLDB_URL` in the example). Make sure to set your script as no-mod to protect the secret value from discovery.

The service is meant to operate as much as possible like the Experience key-value store, so results will be returned as HTTP 200s with comma delimited lists as for [llReadKeyValue()](https://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LlReadKeyValue) and [llUpdateKeyValue()](https://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LlUpdateKeyValue).

The size of values is limited to 4095 characters; maximum length of keys is 1011 characters. Table size is subject only to the [AWS limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ServiceQuotas.html).
